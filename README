This project is a library that aims at making the use of
named comet actors in Lift a little easier.

You will need to clone this project and using sbt 0.7.x you will do:

sbt +update +publish-local

That command will compile the library and publish it to
your local computer.

Then on your lift project you can add the dependency as:

val namedCometActor= "fmpwizard" %% "lift-named-comet" % "0.2"

For a sample project using this library visit:

Enjoy
